# ECommerce
E-Commerce Website build for e-commerce university class, using ASP.Net MVC, and SQL Server Database connected trough Entity Framework Code First.

## Description
In E-Commerce class was proposed to build a webpage as our pratical avaliation, so to buil a e-commerce webpage that we didnt had much time to build we decided to built it trough Code First Entity Framework so that the project could be faster to build and not be worring about the data structure but more on the design. For the project to be great on the front end we researched other websites to know what was necessary and we aplied the best ideas we saw fit. One of our primary concerns was to have a multi language plataform since our language portuguese not being well know and english being fundamental in any platform to survive. We are using images from other websites since this platform wasn't ment to be used, was only for a class project and we didnt had time to create a catalog of products.
